# Redis with Python: Project Overview

## Introduction

This project involves the integration of Redis, an in-memory data structure store, into a Python-based environment on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Redis is known for its efficiency in handling real-time data, making it a popular choice for caching, message brokering, and key-value store applications. In this project, Redis will be used to perform basic operations and as a simple caching solution.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Understand Basic Redis Operations**: Learn how to interact with Redis using key commands for common tasks such as storing and retrieving data.
- **Implement Redis as a Cache**: Leverage Redis to cache frequently accessed data, improving performance for data retrieval tasks in Python applications.
  
## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: Python 3.7
- **Code Style**: Adherence to `pycodestyle` (version 2.5) is required for all submitted files.
- **Documentation**: 
  - All modules, classes, and functions must be properly documented. Documentation should clearly explain the purpose of the module, class, or method, and should not be limited to a single word.
  - Ensure that each file begins with the line `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
  - The first line of every file should include a new line at the end.

## Installation Instructions

To install Redis on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and set it up for this project:

1. Install Redis server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
   ```

2. Install the Python Redis client:
   ```bash
   pip3 install redis
   ```

3. Configure Redis to bind to the local machine:
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i "s/bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1/g" /etc/redis/redis.conf
   ```

4. Restart the Redis server:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart redis-server
   ```

## Project Structure

The project includes multiple Python modules that perform Redis operations. The structure adheres to the following guidelines:

- **Type Annotations**: Every function and coroutine must include type annotations for better code clarity and maintainability.
- **Testing**: Test scripts should validate the expected behavior of Redis commands and the caching mechanism.
- **README.md**: This file is included at the root of the project directory to document setup instructions, usage, and details of the implementation.

## Usage

Once Redis is installed and configured, you can use the Python Redis client to connect to the Redis server and perform basic operations:

- **Connecting to Redis**:
  ```python
  import redis
  
  r = redis.Redis(host='127.0.0.1', port=6379, db=0)
  ```

- **Basic Operations**:
  - Set a key-value pair:
    ```python
    r.set('key', 'value')
    ```
  - Get the value associated with a key:
    ```python
    r.get('key')
    ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to set up and use Redis in a Python environment for basic operations and caching. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in managing an in-memory data store, improving your ability to work with real-time data in Python applications.
